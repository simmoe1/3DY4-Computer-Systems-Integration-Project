## DSP Primitives in C++

The purpose of this 3DY4 lab is to provide a link between the modeling of (DSP) primitives used in Software DeÔ¨Åned Radios (SDRs) in an interpreted and scripting language like Python to their implementation in C++. The details are in the lab [document](doc/3dy4-lab2.pdf).

The start-up C++ code is in the [src](src/) sub-folder. A few good pointers to get you started with GDB are available [here](doc/gdb-getting-started.md).

Both the in-lab experiments and the take-home exercises are due 14 hours before your next lab is scheduled.
